#  EternalSOL ‚Äì  Will Creation on Solana

EternalSOL is a platform that allows users to create secure wills. These wills are claimable by recipients after a set period of user inactivity, offering protection for your assets in cases of lost private keys, death, or prolonged absence.

Built with **Next.js**, **Turborepo**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, the app is optimised for performance, developer experience, and scalability.

##  Known Issue

> ‚ùó **Phantom Wallet Compatibility**  
CryptoWill currently **does not work with the Phantom wallet** due to a signing issue related to durable nonce transactions. We're actively working on a fix.  
In the meantime, please use other supported Solana wallets like **Solflare**, **Backpack**, or **Glow** for a smooth experience.
